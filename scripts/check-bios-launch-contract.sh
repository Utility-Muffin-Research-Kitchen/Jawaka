# Shallow wiring check for the Saturn BIOS caller/wrapper contract agreed in
# umrk-workspace/plans/bios-selection-menu.md. Behavioral coverage lives in
# bios-test, in Yabasanshiro-standalone's smoke-launch-wrapper, and on the
# device; this catches regressions at the main.c call sites those cannot reach.
#
# What it guards:
#   * YABASANSHIRO_BIOS_MODE/FILE are written ONLY in the forked child, so the
#     long-lived daemon environment never carries a game's choice and no
#     non-Saturn child inherits one.
#   * The choice is resolved and refused BEFORE the display handoff, so a stale
#     selection cannot strand the user on a black screen.
#   * The request path refuses too, while the launcher is still on screen.
#   * "auto" is never produced by the new UI path.
#   * The launcher persists a logical choice, never a transient absolute path.
