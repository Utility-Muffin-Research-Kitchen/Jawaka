/* 5-Game Mode ("focus mode") — the persistent state + recovery plumbing shared
   by the daemon (boot check) and the launcher/settings UI (later phases).
   See plans/five-game-mode.md for the full design.

   The mode curates up to five games and locks the device into a stripped focus
   screen. This module owns:
     - the persisted settings keys and their (de)serialization,
     - the salted PIN hash + verify,
     - the SD recovery lock file, and
     - the boot decision (enter focus vs. normal launcher, with the
       delete-the-lock-file escape hatch).
   It carries no UI and no device dependencies, so it is unit-testable natively. */
