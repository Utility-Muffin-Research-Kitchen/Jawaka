/* Box-art lookup shared by the library scan and the scraper's missing-art
   check, so both agree on what counts as a game's art.

   Accepted: <stem>.png, <stem>.jpg, <stem>.jpeg, with the extension matched
   case-insensitively. Within a folder PNG beats JPG beats JPEG; within a
   format the all-lower spelling wins, then all-upper, then mixed spellings in
   bytewise order. The stem is compared byte for byte, so on a case-sensitive
   card (ext4, or the MLP1's utf8 vfat mount) "Game" never borrows "game.jpg";
   where a folder's filesystem folds case, the stem is compared without case,
   matching what opening the file by name would find. The result is the
   spelling that exists on disk and never depends on directory order.

   Folders are read with readdir and matched in memory. Probing spellings with
   stat was far slower on FAT, where every miss reads the whole directory: a
   cold scan of 1500 JPEG covers in one folder took 40 s instead of 8 s. */
