/* SVC-1's restart policy (contracts.md#svc-1--service-manifest, "Restart
 * policy"): "`on-failure` uses bounded backoff of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 seconds.
 * Five failures within five minutes opens a circuit breaker and leaves
 * the service stopped with an actionable reason. A user-initiated Run or
 * Restart clears the breaker. `on-failure` never applies after an
 * intentional stop, a lifecycle-policy stop, a package operation, or
 * shutdown."
 *
 * This module is pure decision logic: it holds no clock, spawns nothing,
 * and touches no filesystem. The caller is responsible for actually
 * restarting the service after the returned delay, for arranging its own
 * timer/callback to do so, and for never calling
 * jw_svc_backoff_record_failure() at all for the excluded stop reasons
 * above -- this module cannot distinguish "the service crashed" from
 * "the caller stopped it on purpose" and does not try to.
 *
 * "Five failures within five minutes" is interpreted as a sliding window
 * over the CURRENT run of up to 5 most recent consecutive failures: the
 * breaker opens exactly when a 5th recorded failure exists and the
 * oldest of the 5 most recent failures is no more than five minutes
 * before the newest. This means widely-spaced failures (each more than
 * five minutes apart) never trip the breaker on count alone -- they are
 * evidence the service does eventually run, not that it is stuck in a
 * crash loop -- but every individual failure still gets the escalating
 * backoff delay, capped at the sequence's last entry (16s) once 5 or
 * more consecutive failures have been recorded.
