/* app-services-v1 (SVC-1) manifest validation.
 *
 * Normative source: plans/leaf-syncthing/contracts.md#svc-1--service-manifest
 * in the umrk-workspace sibling checkout. Schema and fixtures:
 * contracts/leaf-services/{app-services-v1.schema.json,manifests/} there.
 * Rejection reason slugs returned by jw_service_manifest_validate() match
 * the fixture directory names under manifests/invalid/ exactly, so a test
 * can walk that fixture tree and assert reason-for-reason without a
 * separate translation table.
 *
 * This module validates ONE already-read pak.json's shape and (where the
 * rule requires it) the filesystem around it. It does not discover apps,
 * does not detect a duplicate service.id across two different paks (that
 * is a cross-manifest check the caller must do once it has validated every
 * candidate), and does not implement supervision, IPC, or persistence --
 * those are separate A2 work.
