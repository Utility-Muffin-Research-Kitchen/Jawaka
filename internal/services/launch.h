/* app-services-v1 (SVC-1) service launch: the fork()/exec() half of
 * supervision step 3
 * (plans/leaf-syncthing/contracts.md#svc-1--service-manifest,
 * "Supervision and process ownership").
 *
 * This module turns one already-validated manifest plus an already-held
 * generation-lease descriptor into a running supervised process group.
 * It is deliberately NOT the supervisor: it does not validate the
 * manifest (internal/services/manifest.c), acquire the lease
 * (internal/services/lease.c), record the ownership reservation
 * (internal/services/reservation.c), decide restart/backoff
 * (internal/services/backoff.c), or stop the group
 * (internal/services/stop.c). It only LAUNCHES, exactly once per call,
 * and reports the new leader's pid so the caller can persist the
 * reservation.
 *
 * What the child does, in order, before exec:
 *
 *   1. setpgid(0, 0)        -- a NEW process group whose pgid equals the
 *                              child pid. This is the group every later
 *                              SVC-1 operation (stop, absence check,
 *                              signalling) targets, and the reason the
 *                              caller must not reap the leader early
 *                              (see below).
 *   2. dup2(lease_fd, 3)    -- first relocate the caller's lease/log fds
 *                              off all reserved descriptors, then place the
 *                              inherited generation lease on descriptor 3
 *                              with FD_CLOEXEC CLEARED so it survives exec.
 *                              UMRK_SERVICE_LEASE_FD=3 was prepared in the
 *                              parent-built child environment. Per SVC-1
 *                              the lock rides the open file description
 *                              across fork+exec and is released only when
 *                              the last duplicate closes (ordinary exit).
 *   3. PR_SET_PDEATHSIG     -- Linux only (MLP1): ask the kernel to send
 *                              the service SIGTERM when its parent
 *                              (Jawaka) dies, closing the set-then-
 *                              recheck race per SVC-1's "Descendant
 *                              survival" note. There is no macOS
 *                              analogue (this dev machine's 26.x SDK has
 *                              no pdwaitpid), so on macOS this step is a
 *                              documented no-op and supervisor-death
 *                              cleanup is exercised on Linux instead.
 *   4. stdout/stderr        -- redirected into the service's rotating
 *                              bounded log (see jw_svc_launch_open_log)
 *                              per supervision step 5.
 *   5. exec                 -- run.path resolved against the pak root,
 *                              with run.args, in the caller-supplied
 *                              environment.
 *
 * THE CALLER OWNS THE RESERVATION RULE. On success this returns the
 * leader's pid (== its pgid). SVC-1 requires Jawaka, as the leader's
 * parent, to NOT waitpid() it until the whole group is confirmed
 * writer-free: an unreaped leader keeps its pid -- and therefore the
 * pgid number -- allocated, so a recycled pgid can never be mistaken for
 * this service. Reaping happens only after jw_svc_group_absent()
 * reports the group gone, never before. This module does not enforce
 * that ordering; it cannot. It only hands back the pid.
