/* contracts.md's SVC-1 "When a stop cannot be verified" table (a group
 * that outlived SIGKILL, or an earlier Jawaka generation still holding
 * the lease -- either way, the reserved group is not provably absent):
 *
 *   | Caller                                   | Behavior |
 *   | ----------------------------------------- | -------- |
 *   | Shutdown, reboot, exit-to-stock           | Continue the platform transition; record the warning. |
 *   | Suspend                                   | Continue; record the warning. |
 *   | Safe unmount (stop_on_storage_change)      | Fail the unmount and tell the user which service is stuck. |
 *   | Game launch (LIFE-1 fallback)             | Do not launch silently. Surface the stuck service and require an explicit user override. |
 *   | PKG-1 / TXN-1                              | Fail the package operation. Never change bytes under a live process. |
 *
 * This module is that table alone, as a pure lookup: given which caller
 * is asking, it returns what to do with the caller's immediate operation
 * when the caller already knows a stop could not be verified absent. It
 * does not decide whether a stop IS verified
 * (internal/services/stop.c and ownership.c do that); it has no I/O and
 * holds no state.
 *
 * The five values below are the table's decision contexts, not every way
 * a service can enter the stop sequence. In particular, CTL-1 Stop,
 * Disable, and Restart do not add rows. Regardless of this lookup's
 * result, the supervisor must not start a replacement group until the
 * prior reserved group is proven absent.
