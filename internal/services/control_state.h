/* SVC-1's per-service control state (contracts.md#svc-1--service-manifest;
 * A2's own "Ordered work" step 3, "Persistent and session control state,
 * including survival across daemon restart"): one row per service id,
 * holding persistent "Start with Leaf" intent, session Run/Stop, the last
 * transition and reason, the last exit status and time, restart count, a
 * backoff/circuit-breaker snapshot, and installed package identity.
 *
 * This module is its own small SQLite database, deliberately independent
 * of jawakad's existing library.db schema and migration system in
 * internal/db/db.c -- adding a table there means bumping a live
 * `PRAGMA user_version` migration that every existing Jawaka installation
 * would run through, which is a materially different risk than a new,
 * separate database file this module owns end to end. Folding this into
 * the shared schema, if ever wanted, is a deliberate later decision for
 * whoever wires this into jawakad, not something this module presumes.
 *
 * "Persistent" here means "survives a daemon restart AND a device
 * reboot": the caller opens this store against a path on durable
 * storage, and everything written to it stays until explicitly changed.
 * "Session" fields (currently just `session_run`) live in the same row
 * for simplicity but are NOT self-clearing -- contracts.md requires
 * session Run/Stop to reset on every daemon start, so the daemon owner's
 * startup sequence MUST call jw_svc_control_store_clear_all_sessions()
 * once before trusting any jw_svc_control_store_get() result. Opening an
 * additional handle (for example, in a CLI process) is not a daemon start
 * and must not clear session state.
 *
 * SQLite's normal file locking plus a 2000 ms busy timeout makes each
 * get(), put(), and clear operation atomic and safe with handles in
 * multiple processes. This API does not make a get/modify/put sequence
 * atomic across handles: concurrent whole-row writers are last-writer-
 * wins and can overwrite one another's fields. The integration layer
 * should designate one writer (normally jawakad, with CLIs using CTL-1)
 * or provide its own serialization. This store does not force WAL mode;
 * the default rollback journal is sufficient for these small operations
 * and avoids imposing WAL filesystem requirements on the caller's
 * eventual choice of durable path.
 *
 * This module does no process supervision, no manifest parsing, and
 * knows nothing about the other SVC-1 primitives' headers -- callers
 * translate between this struct and whatever the rest of the supervisor
 * uses (e.g. internal/services/backoff.h's jw_svc_backoff_state has the
 * same shape as the backoff_failure_times_us/backoff_failure_count/
 * breaker_open fields below by design, but this header does not include
 * backoff.h to stay independently branchable).
