/* SVC-1's ownership reservation (contracts.md#svc-1--service-manifest,
 * "Supervision and process ownership" step 4): "atomically records the
 * group's ownership reservation in runtime tmpfs: the leader's pid (which
 * is the pgid), monotonic launch instant, and a normalized snapshot of
 * the validated lifecycle policy... A missing/corrupt policy snapshot
 * fails safe after a daemon restart."
 *
 * This module is the record's storage alone: atomic write (temp file in
 * the same directory, full write, fsync, rename, then a parent-directory
 * fsync -- the exact recipe contracts.md's LIFE-1 section spells out for
 * its own active-launch record, reused verbatim here since it is the
 * same durability requirement) and a read that distinguishes "no record"
 * from "a record exists but could not be trusted" -- SVC-1 requires a
 * caller to react differently to each (a missing record for a service
 * that was never running is unremarkable; a corrupt one after a crash
 * must fail safe as though every stop trigger were enabled).
 *
 * This module does not create or harden the per-service directory it
 * writes into -- that is internal/services/lease.c's job
 * (jw_svc_lease_acquire()), which SVC-1's own ordering runs first. A
 * write here assumes that directory already exists.
 */

/* Distinct name from manifest.h's jw_svc_lifecycle_game (internal/
 * services/manifest.h, a separately-reviewed, independently-branched
 * module) even though the three values mean the same thing -- these
 * primitives are deliberately independent of each other's headers. */
