/* ---- Background cover decoder -----------------------------------------------
   Generating a thumbnail means decoding the full ~1MB source image, which blocks
   the UI thread ~200ms — so the *first* pass through a list (before any thumbnails
   exist) stutters, and the cover under the cursor shows blank until it is built.
   Move that decode to a worker thread with two inputs:
     - a high-priority slot = the cover under the cursor (latest wins), decoded
       first and handed back to the UI as a texture; and
     - a low-priority FIFO queue = the rest of the visible list (pre-warm), decoded
       only when the priority slot is idle. Pre-warm decodes just write the
       thumbnail to disk; the surface is discarded, so when the cursor later lands
       on that cover the loader hits the fast on-disk thumbnail path.
   Net effect: scroll freely while covers fill in a beat ahead of the cursor, in
   Favorites/Recents/search/systems alike. Existing thumbnails usually decode
   inline, but coverflow motion can route them through the worker to avoid
   mid-animation hitches.

   A decode that fails (unreadable or invalid art) is a result too: the file is
   remembered with its identity, callers get JW_COVER_FAILED and draw their
   placeholder, and the same unchanged file is decoded at most
   JW_COVER_FAIL_ATTEMPTS times. Replacing the file, or a library rescan
   (jw_cover_loader_forget_failures), lets it load again.

   Surfaces are opaque here; the launcher supplies decode/free callbacks, which
   keeps the scheduling testable without SDL. */
