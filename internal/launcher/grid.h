/* Grid View — a vertical-scrolling grid of rounded system tiles.

 * Geometry, cursor movement and tile drawing live here; the launcher keeps
 * orchestration (which items, what activating one does) and hands icons in
 * through a callback, mirroring the coverflow module. Nothing in here reads
 * launcher state.
