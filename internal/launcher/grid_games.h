/* Grid View's games list.
 *
 * A scrolling list of names on the left and the selected game's cover on the
 * right, both over the theme's wallpaper. The list and the info sit on
 * translucent underlays; the cover does not, so the artwork reads as artwork
 * rather than as another widget.
 *
 * Geometry and drawing live here; the launcher keeps orchestration and hands
 * rows, art and metadata in through callbacks, mirroring coverflow.c and grid.c.
 * Nothing in here reads launcher state.
 *
 * Design record: umrk-workspace/plans/grid-view-and-user-themes.md. */
