     carries the narrow capability record
     <platform_dir>/emulators/flycast/ra-account-v1 with the contract id as
     its content. A matching core id, filename or substring alone is not
     enough, and a provider-bound core never takes this branch.

   - DSperate: a provider-bound core with provider "mlp1/DSperate.pak", core
     id "dsperate", resolved launcher exactly <pak>/scripts/run.sh, an
     installed <pak>/pak.json with id "org.umrk.dsperate" and
     pak_version >= 2.1.1, and the capability record the pak ships,
     <pak>/ra-account-v1, holding exactly the contract id (one trailing
     newline allowed, the same rule as the Flycast record). The published
     2.0.0 build does not consume the contract, so it receives no
     credentials; a build without the record receives none either.

   Everything else, and every check that cannot be positively established
   (missing files, unreadable manifests, malformed versions), is refused. */
