   action can actually help. Kept free of UI code so every rule is testable:
   the screens in internal/settings/storage_ui.c only turn an advice into text.

   The order matters most after a check. "check" mode runs a read-only
   fsck.fat -n: it can prove a card clean, but it never fixes anything. Once a
   check has finished and found errors, checking again gives the same answer
   forever, so the only useful next step is a repair. */
