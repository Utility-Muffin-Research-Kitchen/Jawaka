/* What a Pak Rat package installs, and under which root.
 *
 * Apps and content paks install to Apps/<platform>/<Name>.pak on whichever
 * card owns them. Themes install to Themes/<id>/ on the primary card, the only
 * place the launcher discovers user themes.
 *
 * The root travels inside install_path so that every record, marker and lock
 * that stores only an install_path still resolves to the right place: an app's
 * install_path is Apps-relative ("mlp1/Name.pak"), as it always has been, and a
 * theme's names its root ("Themes/neon-nights"). No platform is called
 * "Themes", and the catalog refuses one. pakrat_installs.kind records the same
 * fact explicitly and is checked against the path. */
