   this contract parses `apps[]`, ignores the unknown `content` key, and never
   learns a content pak exists -- which is the whole reason the lane is a new
   key rather than a field on an existing one.

   The lane is metadata for what the store SHOWS. It never decides whether

   version is gated (THEME-1 requires min_leaf_version), and the legacy fields
   mirror the newest entry. A launcher that predates themes ignores the key,
   so the storefront schema stays 1.

   Ids are unique across apps[], content[] and themes[]. `withdrawn` is the one
   change a published entry may receive besides new versions; a withdrawn theme
