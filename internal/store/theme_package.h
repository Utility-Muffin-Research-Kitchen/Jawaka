/* THEME-1: the Leaf theme package (leaf-contracts docs/themes.md).
 *
 * The install-time half of the contract. It must agree reason for reason with
 * the store's reference validator (contracts/leaf-themes/scripts/theme_model.py)
 * and runs the same stages in the same order:
 *
 *   1-3  container, declared sizes, integrity  -- read from the zip itself
 *   4    entry names, types and the allowlist  -- read from the zip itself
 *   5    theme.json and image headers          -- read from the extracted tree
 *
 * Only allowlisted files are ever written to disk, so stage 5 judges exactly
 * the files a device would keep. `make theme-package-test` runs this module
 * over every contract fixture. */
