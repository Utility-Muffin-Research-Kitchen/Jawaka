/* CAT-1, the effective catalog. Normative text:
   umrk-workspace/plans/pak-rat/content-paks-contract.md#cat-1
   Schemas and fixtures: leaf-contracts/contracts/leaf-content/

   The catalog a reader loads is a content-addressed immutable generation
   directory, selected by a one-line file that is replaced atomically:

     $UMRK_INTERNAL_DATA_PATH/catalog/
       current              "gen-<64 hex>\n", replaced by rename()
       diagnostics.json     OUTSIDE any generation, so a failed compile
                            still leaves a readable explanation
       gen-<digest>/        written once, never mutated
         systems.json  cores.json  info/  stamp.json

   A directory cannot replace a non-empty directory via rename() -- that
   fails ENOTEMPTY -- which is why publication swaps a small file and never
   the directory itself.

   Producer and readers do deliberately different amounts of work:

     jawakad   full provenance validation (rehash every input) at startup
               and before a ROM scan, then recompile and republish
     readers   structural validation only, per catalog load

   Readers never rehash a core binary on a request path; freshness is the
   producer's job. There is no "serve the last good generation" branch
   anywhere: a stale catalog silently pins a user to a pre-OTA system list,
   which is worse than not shipping the feature. */
