/* User-facing string lookup.
 *
 * The English string is the key. `T("Settings")` returns the translation when
 * one is loaded and the literal itself otherwise, so a missing or partial
 * translation degrades to English with no call-site handling. That property is
 * the whole reason the key is the source string rather than an enum: a
 * community translation lands incomplete and stays incomplete for a while.
 *
 * Wrap ONLY user-facing text. Log messages, IPC message types, DB column names,
 * file paths and env var names must stay unwrapped -- they look like UI strings
 * to a regex, which is why the wrapping pass cannot be automated.
 *
 * Identical English needing different translations takes a context prefix that
 * the compiler strips from the displayed text: T("verb|Open") and T("noun|Open")
 * are distinct keys, both rendering "Open" when untranslated.
 *
 * The returned pointer is owned by the table and stays valid until
 * jw_i18n_shutdown(). Do not free it, and do not hold it across a language
 * change -- the launcher relaunches on a language change, so in practice that
 * means do not stash it in a long-lived global.

/* Marks a UI string that cannot be wrapped in T() where it is written, because
 * it lives in a `static const` initializer and T() is a function call. Expands
 * to the string itself, so codegen is unchanged; it exists purely so the
 * extractor can see the string, and so a reader can tell UI text from a config
 * key or a file path sitting in the same kind of table.
 *
 * The value is still translated at the point it is drawn -- the row renderers
 * call T() on whatever they are handed -- so this marks the string for
 * EXTRACTION, not for lookup. Both halves are needed: an unmarked string never
 * reaches the .po, and a marked string in a renderer that forgets T() renders
 * English no matter how good the translation is.
 *
 *   static const char *const kFontSizeLabels[] = { JW_UI("Small"), ... };
 *
 * This replaces a hand-maintained list of table names in the extractor. That
 * list failed silently: forget to register a table and everything builds,
 * ships, and looks right until a native speaker reads the screen. A missing
 * JW_UI is at least visible in review, next to its marked neighbours.
 *
 * Do NOT mark proper nouns. Font families, theme ids and product names stay
 * English on purpose, and marking them only invites a translator to change
 * something that should not change.
