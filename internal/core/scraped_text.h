/* Make one field of scraped metadata safe to draw.
 *
 * ScreenScraper serves its text HTML-escaped and with real line breaks inside
 * it, and Leaf draws that text straight into a wrapped box. So `&quot;` reaches
 * the screen literally, and a newline reaches the font as an unmapped glyph and
 * comes out as tofu. This resolves both: entities decode to their characters,
 * and every control byte becomes a space, after which runs of whitespace
 * collapse and the ends are trimmed.
 *
 * In place. Every transformation shrinks or preserves length -- the shortest
 * entity that decodes to four UTF-8 bytes is eight characters -- so the result
 * always fits the buffer it arrived in. Decoded output is written past the read
 * cursor and never rescanned, so "&amp;quot;" decodes once, to `&quot;`, rather
 * than collapsing all the way to a quote.
 *
 * Paragraph breaks flatten to a single space: the info box is a few lines of
 * wrapped prose with no room to honour them.
