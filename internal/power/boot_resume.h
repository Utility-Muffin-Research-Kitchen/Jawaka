/* Resume Game on Boot: one pending continuation of one power-button shutdown.

   A power-hold save that ends `saved` writes boot-resume.json into the
   launcher control state ($UMRK_INTERNAL_DATA_PATH). The next daemon start
   reads it once and deletes it before deciding anything, so a boot gets at most
   one attempt. The record names the game, core and state file; it does not hash
   anything. Whether the state still fits is settled by RetroArch's
   LOAD_STATE_SYNC reply, never here.

   Everything in this module takes paths, the platform and the current boot id
   as arguments so host tests need no device. Plan:
   umrk-workspace/plans/Jawaka/auto-resume-after-power-off.md. */
