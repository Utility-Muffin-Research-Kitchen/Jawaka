/* jawaka-ledd's write policy for frames that change rarely or never: static,
 * off, and Battery Level. Pure logic, shared by main.c and battery_test.c.
 *
 * Every mmrgball write is ~44 interrupts on the LED's I2C bus and ~20 helper
 * wakeups even when nothing changed, so these effects run a slow pass and
 * write only when the frame changes, after a resume (the chip may have lost
 * its registers in suspend), or on a slow safety refresh. On the MLP1 that
 * measured 0.6 helper wakeups/s for Battery Level against 22.6 for a Static
 * that rewrote its frame every second. */
