# Launch exit barriers

This is the A3b audit of every foreground path by which Leaf launches content
or an app. It is also the eligibility boundary for LIFE-1: only
`RETROARCH` and `EMULATOR` emit `game.start` / `game.finish`.

## The common barrier

Before either qualifying child can execute, the child calls `setpgid(0, 0)`
and the daemon calls `setpgid(pid, pid)`. Calling it on both sides closes the
fork/exec race. The daemon records that pgid with the active launch.

On leader exit, `jawakad` uses `waitid(..., WNOWAIT)` so the zombie leader
continues to reserve its pid/pgid. It does not reap until the group-absence
check proves that the group contains no non-zombie process. It then runs the
source/session finalizer and only afterwards clears `active-game.json` and
emits `game.finish`. Shutdown and forced-quit signals target the same group.

`internal/launcher/writer_group_test.c` and the LIFE-1 game fixture prove the
important wrapper case: the direct child exits while a writer descendant stays
alive, and neither the active record nor `game.finish` is released early.

## MLP1 launch inventory

| Path | Jawaka `child_kind` | LIFE-1 events | What is waited for | Saves/States writer | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RetroArch content, all libretro cores | `RETROARCH` | Yes | Reserved RetroArch process group; then shared-config/session finalizer | Yes | Proven |
| Mupen64Plus standalone | `EMULATOR` | Yes | Reserved group containing `launch.sh`, Mupen64Plus, and descendants; then standalone finalizer | Yes | Proven |
| PPSSPP standalone | `EMULATOR` | Yes | Reserved group; wrapper `exec`s `PPSSPPSDL`; then standalone finalizer | Yes | Proven |
| DraStic standalone | `EMULATOR` | Yes | Reserved group; wrapper `exec`s `drastic64`; then standalone finalizer | Its package currently writes internal emulator state, not the shared Saves/States preset | Proven |
| Flycast standalone | `EMULATOR` | Yes | Reserved group; wrapper `exec`s Flycast; then standalone finalizer | Yes | Proven |
| PortMaster port from the Ports system | `EMULATOR` | Yes | Jawaka proves only its outer launcher group. The launcher deliberately starts the selected port with `setsid` and waits for that session leader, but arbitrary port scripts may daemonize descendants. | No routine writer to Leaf's shared Saves/States roots; PortMaster uses its own userdata roots | Unproven for arbitrary ports |
| Foreground `.pak` app, including Thing-File and the RetroArch settings pak | `APP` | No | Direct child pid only; no general descendant barrier | Not an audited automatic writer. Manual file editing/loading is outside the guarantee | Unproven by design |
| PortMaster manager pak | `APP` | No | Direct child pid only | Writes PortMaster userdata, not the shared preset | Unproven by design |
| Jawaka launcher | `LAUNCHER` | No | Direct child pid | No | Not applicable |
| Normal or in-game menu | `MENU` / separately tracked menu child | No | Direct child pid | No; save requests are completed by the active emulator before a handoff | Not applicable |
| Stock `loong_pangu` launcher-switcher wrapper | Outside Jawaka | No | The stock wrapper `exec`s the Leaf session; it is the boot/session owner, not a content child | No | Not applicable |

The four standalone packages in the default MLP1 payload were inspected at
their packaged launch scripts. Mupen64Plus runs its binary synchronously in the
inherited group; PPSSPP, DraStic, and Flycast use `exec`; none calls `setsid`,
`setpgid`, or backgrounds the emulator. Thus the daemon's reserved group covers
their routine writers. PortMaster is explicitly different and is kept outside
the automatic Saves/States eligibility promise.

## Content switching

The game switcher no longer retargets RetroArch in-process. A switch first
settles the old savestate write, asks the old RetroArch process to quit, and
waits for its full group barrier and finalizer. Only then can the daemon commit
a fresh active record and run LIFE-1 for the next title. This preserves the
one-launch/one-`launch_id` invariant even when the old and new games use the
same core and card.

## Product boundary

The Release P automatic preset may include shared Saves and States because all
routine writers of those trees in the default MLP1 emulator payload have a
proven barrier. ROM trees, app userdata, arbitrary PortMaster data, and manual
file-manager edits are not covered. Opening a `.pak` therefore neither pauses
nor stops sync; the UI and documentation must continue to warn that manual
editing of a managed tree while sync is active is outside the safety guarantee.
